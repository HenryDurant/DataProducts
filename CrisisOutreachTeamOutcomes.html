    <h2>Background: Crisis Outreach Team</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>The Crisis Outreach Team has been working with the Austin Police Department (APD) and the Pflugerville Police Department (PPD) to create more positive outcomes for those with mental illness who come into contact with Law Enforcement. The program has been running since 1/1/15, and has worked with 1108 people between then and 2015-09-29. </p>

    <h2>The Process</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>When law enforcement suspect a person to be experiencing mental illness, they call the Crisis Outreach team to the scene, who work with people to find the outcome that provides the most appropriate level of care in the least restrictive environment. Ideally, the crisis outreach team works with the person in the community to link them to services. A person is seen as &#39;Diverted&#39; if they do not enter the justice system. This means they are not arrested or taken against their will to a treatment facility. Since 1/1/15, 954 people have been diveted from the justice system after the Crisis Team intervened. </p>

    <h2>Who Wants to Know What?</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>There are numerous interest groups eager to examine the outcomes of this service from many different perspectives. The following application allows the exploration of outcomes by several parameters. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>The primary reason for the team&#39;s dispatch, which includes psychosis, suicidal ideation, self injurious behaviour, disturbance of mood, and prescription issues. </li>
<li>The police departments served, with options including the Austin Police Department (APD), Pflugerville Police Department (PPD), or both departments (All).</li>
<li>You may also select a date range. The data runs from 1/1/15 - 2015-09-29 (and is simulated in this case). </li>
</ul>
